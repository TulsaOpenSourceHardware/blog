This past Saturday was one of Tulsa Web Dev's "Hack Days" in which a new service was born.  Codesy.io is a service that brings developers and projects together.  By providing incintive to developers through bug fix 'bids', project developers can increase their open source presence.
Unlike other bid services like Boundy Source, Codesy provides the option for project managers to hide the bid value from potential developers.  This prevents discouraging developers due to low bid values (e.g. $5) Also, Codesy is being release fully opensourced.  This allows anyone to help contribute to the project.

For more info, checkout [Codesy.io](http://codesy.io) and the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/codesy/patronage/)
